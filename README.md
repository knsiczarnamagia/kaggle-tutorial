# üåä Kaggle Tutorial üö¢
> Welcome to the **Kaggle Titanic Tutorial**! This repository is designed as a starter guide for Kaggle competitions, created by **≈öwita Znachora** for WAVE 3 Workshops. üöÄ

The Titanic Competition is a great way to start with Kaggle and machine learning. Your goal is to predict which passengers survived the Titanic tragedy based on various attributes such as age, class, and gender.
